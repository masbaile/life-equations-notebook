    "### The Equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Life Value (V):**  \n",
    "   \\[ V = \\frac{Work}{Stress + Noise} \\]  \n",
    "   - The more stress and noise you add, the lower the value of life. By reducing stress and noise, you increase your life's overall value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplified Life:**  \n",
    "   \\[ V = Work \\times Clarity \\]  \n",
    "   - Clarity amplifies the impact of your work. The clearer your purpose, the more value your work produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Productivity Trap:**  \n",
    "   \\[ Hustle = (More \\times Meetings) - Progress \\]  \n",
    "   - Hustling doesn’t equal progress. Adding more meetings without making progress reduces the overall value of your efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **True Wealth:**  \n",
    "   \\[ Wealth = (Time \\times Purpose) - Distractions \\]  \n",
    "   - Spending time on purposeful activities while reducing distractions increases true wealth. Wealth isn’t just money—it’s living a life aligned with your values.\n",
